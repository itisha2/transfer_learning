Codes are inside the model_projection folder:
  1. create_data.py : It is used to convert the data from conllu format to the datasets (wnut) format understood by the specific BERT model.
  2. marathi_model.py : main script used to finetine the models.
  3. original_wnut.py: Kind of an experimentation script that was created to understand the format of the original wnut dataset so the data used in the assignment can be converted to it.
  4. marathi_model.ipynb: Experimentation notebook created to understand the data.
  5. train_classifier.py: Another script to train the models. It was used for reference but was not explicity used in this pipeline.
